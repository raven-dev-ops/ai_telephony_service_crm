Internal Audit & Management Review
==================================

Cadence
-------
- **Internal audit**: Twice per year (and before external certification). Scope: access control, CI/CD controls, backup/restore evidence, incident handling, vendor DPAs, risk register updates.
- **Management review**: Quarterly with engineering lead, product lead, and executive sponsor. Inputs: risk register, incidents/MTTR, access review results, DR/backup drill results, open nonconformities.

Plan (upcoming)
---------------
- Schedule next internal audit: January 2026 (owner: ISMS lead). Use this folder as the control library.
- Select external certification partner: shortlist and engage by February 2026; target ISO 27001 audit readiness by end of Q1 2026.
- Evidence pack: collect logs (access reviews, DR drills, CI runs, vulnerability scans) per quarter and store in secure share.

Action items
------------
- Create calendar invites for the January 2026 internal audit and quarterly management reviews (attach agenda and evidence links).
- Build an evidence index in the secure share (access logs, DR drill results, CI scan exports, incident log) and link from GitHub issues.
- Track audit findings/nonconformities as GitHub issues labeled `audit` with owners and due dates.
- Finalize shortlist of ISO partners and select target external audit window (Q1 2026).

Outputs
-------
- Internal audit report with findings, severities, and due dates; track as GitHub issues labeled `audit`.
- Management review minutes with decisions on risk acceptance and resource allocations.
