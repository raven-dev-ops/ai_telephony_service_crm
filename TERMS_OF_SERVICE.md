Terms of Service
================

These Terms of Service ("Terms") describe the general expectations for using an AI telephony
assistant and CRM platform (the "Service") as designed in this repository. They are written with a
trades business such as a plumbing company in mind and are intended as a starting point only. They
do **not** constitute legal advice and must be reviewed and adapted by qualified counsel before
production use.


Source PDFs & Traceability
--------------------------

These Terms are informed by:

- `Bristol_Plumbing_Analysis.pdf` – the reference business context and customer experience goals.
- `Bristol_Plumbing_Project_Plan.pdf` – functional and non‑functional requirements for the Service.
- `Bristol_Plumbing_Implementation.pdf` – planned usage patterns for AI, telephony, SMS, and web.
- `Project_Engineering_Whitepaper.pdf` – the engineering culture and safety expectations that
  underpin reliable operation.

They describe how a deployment based on this design should be used at a high level; actual contracts
must be drafted by counsel.


1. Use of the Service
---------------------

- The Service is intended to help a business answer calls, schedule appointments, and manage basic
  customer information.
- The Service is not a replacement for life‑safety or emergency services (e.g., 911). It may detect
  urgent plumbing issues and escalate them to the business, but it does not contact emergency
  responders.
- The business remains responsible for:
  - The quality of services it provides to its customers.
  - The accuracy of information it supplies to the Service.
  - Responding to emergencies and time‑sensitive situations.


2. Accounts & Access
--------------------

- Access to any dashboard or configuration interface should be restricted to authorized users of the
  business.
- Users are responsible for keeping their login credentials secure and for any actions taken under
  their accounts.
- The platform operator may suspend or restrict access in case of suspected misuse or security
  issues.


3. Customer Communications
--------------------------

- The Service may send messages (e.g., SMS or email) to customers on behalf of the business, such
  as appointment confirmations and reminders.
- The business is responsible for:
  - Ensuring it has the right to contact customers (e.g., consent for marketing messages where
    required).
  - The content of messages sent to customers.
  - Honoring opt‑out requests and legal requirements around communications.


4. Data & Privacy
-----------------

- The Service processes customer and call data on behalf of the business, as described in
  `PRIVACY_POLICY.md`.
- The business is responsible for:
  - Ensuring it has lawful grounds to collect and process personal data.
  - Providing appropriate privacy notices to its customers.
  - Configuring retention periods and access controls consistent with law and policy.
- The platform operator is responsible for implementing reasonable technical and organizational
  measures to protect data from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse.


5. Acceptable Use
-----------------

The Service may not be used to:

- Engage in illegal activities or violations of applicable regulations.
- Harass, threaten, or abuse callers or customers.
- Send spam or unwanted marketing communications without consent.
- Attempt unauthorized access to other systems or data.
- Reverse engineer or circumvent security measures of the Service or its providers.


6. Third‑Party Services
-----------------------

- The Service may rely on third‑party providers (e.g., Google Calendar, SMS gateways, cloud
  hosting).
- Those providers' terms and policies apply as well; the business is responsible for maintaining any
  required accounts and complying with applicable terms.


7. Availability & Reliability
-----------------------------

- While the design targets high availability and resilience (see the engineering whitepaper), no
  system can be guaranteed to be free from outages or errors.
- The Service may be temporarily unavailable due to maintenance, upgrades, or failures.
- The business should maintain backup contact methods (e.g., direct phone line or voicemail) for
  critical situations.


8. Disclaimers
--------------

- The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis during development and pilot phases.
- No warranty is given that:
  - All calls will be answered successfully.
  - All emergencies will be correctly detected or handled.
  - The system will be free of bugs or vulnerabilities.


9. Limitation of Liability
--------------------------

To the maximum extent permitted by law:

- The platform operator and contributors are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, or
  consequential damages arising out of or in connection with use of the Service.
- Direct liability (if any) should be limited to amounts actually paid by the business for use of the
  Service during a defined period (for example, the prior three months), subject to applicable law.


10. Changes to These Terms
--------------------------

- These Terms may be updated as the Service evolves.
- The business operating the Service should:
  - Keep an up‑to‑date version accessible to internal stakeholders and, where applicable,
    customers.
  - Communicate material changes where appropriate.
